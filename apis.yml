      # Overview

      The Call Forwarding Signal (CFS) API provides the API Consumer with

      information about the status of the Call Forwading Service on a specific

      phone number. The main scope of the CFS API is "anti Fraud" to avoid

      fraudsters to use the Call Forwarding Service to carry on a scam. Other
      use

      cases are anyway supported by the CFS API that also provides additional

      endpoints to detect the general Call Forwarding Service settings.

      # Introduction

      The Call Forwarding Service is provided by the Network to a phone

      number. This service redirects the incoming call to that phone number

      to an alternative destination such as another phone number or a voice mail

      system. There are two main types of call forwarding settings:

      unconditional and conditional.

      The CFS API can be invoked to detect if the unconditional

      call forwarding service is active. The CSF API can also be invoked to

      get the general status of the Call Forwarding Service (inactive,

      conditional, unconditional). If conditional call forwarding is active,

      the differente type of settings are returned ('conditional_busy',

      'conditional_unavailable', 'conditional_no_reply').\

      CallForwarding\Signal/discussions/3#discussioncomment-8915595)

      # Quick Start

      The CFS API is a REST API based on the CreateCallForwardingSignal
      resource.

      This resource can be filled during the API invokation, by the API
      Consumer,

      with the phone number on which the Call Forwarding Service status must be

      verified. Anyway the phone number is also detected, by the API Producer,

      from the access token.\

      \

      Before starting to use the Call Forwarding API, the developer needs to
      know

      about the below specified details:\

      \

      **phoneNumber**

      This is the end user phone number. The CFS API verifies if a call
      forwarding

      service is active on this phone number. Note: the value of this optional

      parameter must match the value of the phone number retrieved from the
      access

      token.\

      \

      **CreateCallForwardingSignal**

      This is the resource the API Consumer uses to define the phone number to

      be verified about the status of the Network Call Forwarding service.\

      \

      **UnconditionalCallForwardingSignal**

      This is the resource the API Consumer gets back, containing the
      information

      about the Unconditional Call Forwarding Service status for the given phone

      number (PhoneNumber)\

      \

      **CallForwardingSignal**

      This is the resource the API Consumer gets back, containing the
      information

      about the general status of the Network Call Forwarding service for the

      specified phone number.\

      \

      The CFS API provides two endpoints fulfilling the following intents:

      - **unconditional-call-forwardings**: Is the unconditional call fwd
      service

      active on a specific phone number?

      - **call-forwardings**: Which is the status of the call forwarding for a

      specific phone number?

      # Authorization and authentication

      The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details on how

      a client requests an access token. Please refer to Identify and Consent

      Management
      (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/)

      for the released version of the Profile.\

      \

      Which specific authorization flows are to be used will be determined
      during

      onboarding process, happening between the API Client and the Telco
      Operator

      exposing the API, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing
      the

      API, while also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated
      by

      local legislation.\

      \

      It is important to remark that in cases where personal user data is

      processed by the API, and users can exercise their rights through
      mechanisms

      such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of 3-legged access tokens becomes

      mandatory. This measure ensures that the API remains in strict compliance

      with user privacy preferences and regulatory obligations, upholding the

      principles of transparency and user-centric data control.

      # Identifying the phone number from the access token

      This specification defines the "phoneNumber" field as optional in API

      requests because using a 3-legged access token the phone number can be

      uniquely identified by the token.

      ## Handling of phone number information:

      ### Optional phone number object for 3-legged tokens:

      When using a 3-legged access token, the phone number associated with the

      access token must be considered as the phone number for the API request.

      This means that the "phoneNumber" paramenter is not required in the
      request,

      and if it is included it must identify the same phone number.

      ### Validation mechanism:

      - The server will extract the phone number identification from the access

      token, if available.

      - If the API request additionally includes a "phoneNumber" parameter when

      using a 3-legged access token, the API will validate that the phone number

      identifier provided matches the one associated with the access token.

      - If there is a mismatch, the API will respond with a

      403 `INVALID_TOKEN_CONTEXT` error, indicating that the device information

      in the request does not match the token.

      ### Error handling for unidentifiable devices:

      - If the "phoneNumber" parameter is not included in the request and the

      phone number information cannot be derived from the 3-legged access token,

      the server will return a 422 `UNIDENTIFIABLE_DEVICE` error.

      # API Documentation

      ## Details

      The CFS API is invoked by an API Consumer after the Consent Management

      flow.\

      The API Consumer can request the API Producer for the status of the

      Unconditional Call Forwarding service using the

      unconditional-call-forwardings POST method. A boolean, with the
      information

      about the activation status of the call forwarding service, will be

      provided back via the UnconditionalCallForwardingSignal resource.\

      The API Consumer can also request the API Producer for the generic status
      of

      the Call Forwarding service using the call-forwardings POST method. An
      array

      of strings with the information of the type of active call forwarding

      services will be provided back via the CallForwardingSignal resource.\

      CFS API have to check the Call Forwarding

      Service status can be optionally defined with resource

      (CreateCallForwardingSignal) containing the phone number (PhoneNumber)

      to be checked.

      Traffic Influence API can be invoked again to get the optimal routing in
      the new location.
