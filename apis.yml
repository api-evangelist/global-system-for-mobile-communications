      The API request contains the location to be checked and an accuracy range
      in km (between 2km and 200km). The API response indicates whether the
      location is within the accuracy range of the last known location of the
      MSISDN. In its simplest version, the API can be used to verify a location
      expressed as latitude, longitude, and a radius.
