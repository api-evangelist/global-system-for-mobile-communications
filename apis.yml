  The API request contains the location to be checked and an accuracy range in
  km (between 2km and 200km). The API response indicates whether the location is
  within the accuracy range of the last known location of the MSISDN. In its
  simplest version, the API can be used to verify a location expressed as
  latitude, longitude, and a radius.
